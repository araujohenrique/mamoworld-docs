# Getting Started

Automation Blocks is an extension for Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro that can automate all kinds of tasks. It gives you the full power of the scripting engines of Ae and Pr - but instead of writing program code you just combine blocks!

Here is a teaser for Automation Blocks for Premiere Pro:

Yes, I know, at first sight Automation Blocks can be overwhelming. But don't worry. Nobody becomes an automation hero over night - just follow this guide and you reach your goal already way before dawn!

There are two ways to use Automation Blocks:

### Play with Examples

 Automation Blocks comes with many examples, which do useful things right out of the box. Each example comes with comments. Make sure to read them to understand how the example is used.

In the [Examples section](tutorials-ae/firstStepsAutomationBlocksAe) you find a summary of the most useful ones.

### Write your Own Scripts

In Automation Blocks, you write scripts to automate workflows by combining blocks. It feels more like playing with Lego bricks than doing actual programming. Once you start to customize the example scripts to your needs, or even write your own scripts from scratch - this is where the true magic happens!
