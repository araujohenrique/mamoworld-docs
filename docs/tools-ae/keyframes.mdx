# Keyframes

Automation Blocks contains an entire collection of scripts to simplify the work with keyframes.

## Copy, Paste & Fit Keyframes {#CopyPasteFit}

TODO

## Save Preset {#SavePreset}

You can use this script to save keyframe presets to your Automation Blocks Keyframes Library.
It will save all keyframes from the currently selected properties.

Just execute the following script:

-   **Keyframes Library - Save Preset**

When you execute the script, a dialog pops up where you can set the name of the preset that will be saved:

<RetinaImg
	src="/img/tools-ae/keyframesLibrarySavePresetDialog.png"
	alt="After Effects Script: Keyframes Library - Save Preset - Dialog"
/>

:::danger Selection

Make sure you have at least one property that has keyframes selected.

:::

## Load Preset {#LoadPreset}

You can use this script to load keyframe presets from your Automation Blocks Keyframes Library.

Just execute the following script:

-   **Keyframes Library - Load Preset**

It will load all keyframes from the selected preset to: all layers, selected layers or selected properties
When you execute the script, a dialog pops up where you can selects the preset that will be applied and to which layers/properties.

<RetinaImg
	src="/img/tools-ae/keyframesLibraryLoadPresetDialog.png"
	alt="After Effects Script: Keyframes Library - Save Preset - Dialog"
/>

If you are targeting the preset to multiple layers/properties the keyframes will be applied to every property that matches the property the keyframes were saved from.

For example, a preset that was saved from the Transform/Opacity property will be pasted into every Transform/Opacity property within the targeted layers/properties.

Selection when preset was created:

<RetinaImg
	src="/img/tools-ae/keyframesLibraryMultiplePropsSelected.png"
	alt="After Effects Script: Keyframes Library - Multiple properties selected"
/>

Loaded preset result:

<RetinaImg
	src="/img/tools-ae/keyframesLibraryLoadToMultipleProps.png"
	alt="After Effects Script: Keyframes Library - Keyframes loaded to multiple properties"
/>
