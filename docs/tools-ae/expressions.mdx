# Expressions

Automation Blocks contains various tools to work with expressions more effectively.

## Apply Expressions {#ApplyExpressions}

## Enable/Disable Expressions {#EnableDisableExpressions}

<RetinaImg src="/img/tools-ae/expressionsEnableUI.png" alt="batch enable/disable expressions in After Effects"/>

With the **Enable or Disable Expressions** tool you can enable or disable many expressions at once. In the dialog you have the option to do that for

- all expressions of the project
- all expressions of the active comp
- all expressions of the active comp and its precomps
- all expressions on the selected layers of the active comp
- all expressions on the selected properties of the active comp


## Search & Replace in Expressions {#SearchReplaceExppressions}

<RetinaImg src="/img/tools-ae/expressionsSearchReplaceUI.png" alt="search/replace in expressions"/>

With this tool you can perform a search & replace in

- all expressions of the project
- all expressions of the active comp
- all expressions of the active comp and its precomp
- all currently selected expressions of the active comp

You have an option to search case sensitive and an advanced option to use regular expressions.

### Regular Expressions

Regular Expressions allow to search for a pattern instead of a single search term. 

If you don't know, yet, what regular expressions are, I recommend to [get started here](https://www.regular-expressions.info/).

The pattern must be in Javascript Regular Expression notation and also supports capturing groups. 

In the replace string you can use the placeholder $0, $1, $2,... where $0 represents the full match, $1 the content of the first capturing group, $2 the content of the second capturing group etc.
