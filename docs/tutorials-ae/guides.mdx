# Guides

Automation Blocks contains an entire collection of scripts to simplify the work with guides.

## Create

You can use this script to create guides in the active composition.

Just execute the following script:

-   **Guides - Create**

When you execute the script, a dialog pops up where you can chose the orientation of the guides,
and define at which positions they should be created.

The values should be comma separated and can be in pixels (px) and percentage (%).
If no unit is defined the default is pixels.

	src="/img/tutorials-ae/guideCreateDialog.png"
	alt="After Effects Script: Guides - Create - Dialog"
/>

### Examples of valid values

-   100, 200, 300, 400
-   10px, 100px, 1000px
-   10%, 90%
-   10, 20px, 30%, -40, -50px, -60%

## Save

You can use this script to save the guides in the active composition as a preset.

Just execute the following script:

-   **Guides - Save**

When you execute the script, a dialog pops up where you can chose the preset name, the orientation of the guides,
and define as which unit they should be saved.

<RetinaImg
	src="/img/tutorials-ae/guideSaveDialog.png"
	alt="After Effects Script: Guides - Save - Dialog"
/>

:::tip Units

A guide saved at 100px will always be in the same position independent of the composition dimensions,
but a guide at 10% will be dinamically positioned related to the composition dimensions

## Load

You can use this script to load a guides preset into the active composition.

Just execute the following script:

-   **Guides - Load**

When you execute the script, a dialog pops up where you can select a preset and the orientation of the guides you want to load.

<RetinaImg
	src="/img/tutorials-ae/guideLoadDialog.png"
	alt="After Effects Script: Guides - Load - Dialog"
/>

## Mirror

You can use this script to mirror guides from the active composition.

Just execute the following script:

-   **Guides - Mirror**

When you execute the script, a dialog pops up where you can select which guides you want to mirror.
